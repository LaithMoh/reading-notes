# **What Are JavaScript, JQuery?**

**JavaScript (JS)**

JavaScript is a dynamic, multi-paradigm model-based scripting language that supports imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming styles. JS completes the task on the client-side in a website. 

In other words, it is a client-side programming language. JS has a similar structure like C. In comparison with PHP, JS is different in language, but the same in order of operation.

JS lies in the third layer of the standard pie of web technologies, in which the other two are HTML and CSS.

The three technology layers are stacked appropriately.


**The Differences Between JS And Other Programming Languages**


 **JavaScript**  
 JavaScript (JS) helps encourage    interactivity on the website. This script runs on the user’s browser instead of on the server as well as often uses 3rd party libraries, so it can increase the functionality of the website without having to code from the beginning.


**HTML**

Short for “Hypertext Markup Language,” HTML is one of the most common programming languages on the web and builds the main blocks of a website. Examples of HTML tags are **< p >** for paragraphs and **< img >** for images.

**PHP**

PHP is a server-side language, different from JavaScript running on the client. You can easily find it in PHP-based content management systems like Magento. Yet, it’s also often used with back-end programming and can create the most effective information channel to and from the database.

**CSS**

CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets” which helps webmasters define styles and types of content. You can do it manually with every element in HTML.


Considering programming languages like house construction, HTML will format the architecture of the house, CSS will be the carpet and walls to decorate the home. JavaScript adds interactive elements in the house, such as opening doors and lighting. 

In fact, you can still make a website without JavaScript, but the risk is that your website looks like those in the 1995s.

**Pros Of JavaScript**

There are many reasons why JS stands out from its rivals. Here are some benefits of JavaScript that you can obviously identify when using:

* JS requires no compiler because the web browser can compile JS with HTML;
* It’s easier to learn than other programming languages;
* Errors are more comfortable to spot and therefore easier to correct;
* It can be attached to certain web elements or events by mouse click;
* JS works on many browsers and platforms;
* You can use JavaScript to check the input and minimize manual checking when accessing through the database;
* Website interacts better with visitors;
* Faster and lighter than other programming languages.

**Cons Of JavaScript**

However, nothing is 100% perfect. Every programming language has its drawbacks. Partly because when the language grows to a level like JavaScript, it will attract large numbers of hackers, scammers, and malicious people who are always stalking vulnerabilities and security flaws to take advantage of it.

Some of the shortcomings that can be mentioned are:

1. Vulnerable to exploitation;
2. Can be used to execute malicious code on users’ computers;
3. Sometimes not supported in all browsers;
Large code snippets;
4. May be implemented differently depending on the device,
5. resulting in heterogeneity.





# **JQuery**

As same as open-source software, jQuery acts as the JS library that simplifies the HTML client-side scripting. jQuery synthesizes all problems in JS into a library.

jQuery isn’t a separate programming language. It works in conjunction with JavaScript. With jQuery, you can do more with less effort. jQuery provides APIs that make it easier to browse HTML documents, animations, event handling, and manipulate AJAX.

**Pros Of JQuery**

Some critical features make jQuery so accessible and useful.

* Compact: jQuery is a fairly lightweight library – about 19KB (gzipped).
* Compatible with cross-platform: It automatically fixes errors and runs on all popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, MS Edge, IE, Android, and iOS.
* Easy-to-create Ajax: Thanks to the jQuery library, codes by Ajax can easily interact with the server and update content automatically without having to reload the page.
* Prompt processing of DOM operations: jQuery makes it easy to select DOM elements to traverse, and edit their content using the open-source Selector, which is also known as Sizzle.
* Simplify the creation of effects: Like the code snippet with animation effects, it overlays the lines of code, and you just need to add variables/content.
* Excellent support for HTML event methods: jQuery handles diverse events without messing up the HTML code with Event Handlers.


**Cons Of JQuery**

Despite all those advantages, you should also note a few disadvantages, such as:

1. Slow down the client: The client has to handle many functions created from jQuery. Excessive use of jQuery will make clients slower, especially for weak ones. Therefore, the developers must use an additional cache;
2. Some functions may be missing: JQuery has a lot of functions, depending on the requirements on your site. But many functions haven’t been developed yet, so you may still need to use pure JS to build the missing features.

# **How Can We Distinguish JavaScript, JQuery?**

**JavaScript And JQuery**

JavaScript is an interpreted computer programming language that makes websites more interactive by using web pages as a significant element. Whenever a browser parses the web page, it processes creating a tree-structure presentation in memory.

With JavaScript, you can operate the components of the web page using the tree structure and make any modification (like changing content, layouts, or position of the page) that other programming languages can perform..

In contrast, JQuery acts as the framework of JavaScript, which has to do with standard task webs. JQuery is widely used owing to the fact that it not only summarizes cross-browser compatibility problems but also underscores call-back driven JS programming.
