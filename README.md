What is a text editor?
A text editor is a part of the program that you download and install on your computer, or you can access it over the Internet through a web browser.
The text editor allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you type to create a website. Most common text editor features
  1.) Complete the code
  2.) syntax highlighting.
  3.) Nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
  4) The ability to choose from a healthy range of additives available when you need them.

Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer.
Each computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with the computer is called "text editing". On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with the computer is called Notepad. However, Each list of apps has its own text editor.
Some users download text editors even though there is a computer text editor due to different features, as there are other text editors available that may help you program more efficiently.
If you want to try using the text editors that came with your computer, there are some caveats:
*	Please make sure when using the text editor on your computer that you create the code in a plain text editor.
*	You shouldn't see options to make the text bold, underlined, or italic. Plain text does not contain formatting options.
*	There is no need to bold, underline, or italicize the code. If you can make the text bold, underlined, or italic, you may need to change a setting somewhere.
*	When using a text editor on your computer, be sure to first create a folder on your computer somewhere to store your entire website. While creating new documents using the text editor that comes on your computer, save these files to the appropriate folders or subfolders within the main website folder.
*	Ensure that when saving your file, make sure they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names.
*	I think you'll find that there is no syntax discrimination, no appearances, and no extensions. While you can definitely use it to create a website.
*	It is possible that there are no special bells or whistles at all when using the text editors available on your computer.
*	It is possible that the code will not be completed, which means that your text editor will not help you to find your errors. You will have to find out for yourself.
